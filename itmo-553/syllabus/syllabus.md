**Course Outcomes:**

This course will enable students to be ready to design, build, and implement logging and metrics in monitored applications. Implementing these foundations will allow any system administrator to integrate logging and metric collection to correlate with business objectives.

**Course Student Outcomes:** Students completing this course will be able to:

* Discuss the difference between push and pull metrics
* Discuss the difference between logging and metrics
* Describe event streams are and how they are used in monitoring and metric collection
* Explain and expand upon the use of logging and metrics in regards to Operating System containers
* Design, build, and implement logging and metrics in monitored applications

**Topics to Be Covered**:

* Intro - Monitoring & Measurement Framework
* Managing events and Metrics & Graphing
* Event Routing and Collection
* Containers and Logs
* Building an app & Notifications
* Getting Started & Monitoring Nodes
* Service Discovery
* Alerting & Scaling and Reliability
* Instrumenting Applications & Logging
* Building Monitored Applications & Notification

**Required Textbook:**

None

**Course Notes:**  It is recommended to take notes from the oral discussion portion of the class.

**Attendance:** Undergrad attendance is expected and will be counted as part of your grade.  

**Course Web Site:** [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL")

**Blackboard:** The course will make intensive use of Blackboard [http://blackboard.iit.edu/](http://blackboard.iit.edu/ "Course Document Mangement Site URL") for communications, assignment submissions, group project coordination, providing online resources and administering examinations. All remote students will view the course lectures online via Blackboard, and online readings and other course material will be found on Blackboard.

**Assignments:**  There will be 3 Mini-Projects, and 1 final project.

**Grading:** Grading criteria for (undergrad course number) students will be as follows:

Letter | Description | Percentage
-------|-------------|------------
A | Outstanding work reflecting substantial effort | 90-100%
B | Excellent work reflecting good effort | 80-89.99%
C | Satisfactory work meeting minimum expectations | 70-79.99%
E | Unsatisfactory work |0-69.99%

The final grade for the class will be calculated as follows: (example)

   Name                  Grade    Total Points
----------------------- ------- ----------------
                   MP1:   24%        100
                   MP2:   24%        100
                   MP3:   24%        100                   
         Final Project:   24%        100
            Attendance:    4%         30

**Late Submission:**  By default no late work will be accepted – barring situations beyond our control.

**Academic Honesty:**  All work you submit in this course must be your own.

**Plagiarism:** You must fully attribute all material directly quoted in papers and you must document all sources used in the preparation of the paper using complete, APA-style bibliographic entries. Including directly quoted material in an assignment without attribution or a bibliography entry for the source of the material is always plagiarism and will always be treated as such by me. No more than thirty-three percent of material included in any paper may be direct quotes. Students have submitted plagiarized material in seven of the last eight times I have taught this course and I will not tolerate it. If you submit plagiarized material you WILL receive a grade of ZERO for the assignment or exam question, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies. There is no excuse for not understanding this policy and if you do not understand it please let me know and I will be happy to discuss it with you until you do.

**Collaboration:** Students may only collaborate on assignments or projects that are explicitly designated as group assignments or projects. Students submitting work that is identical or in some cases even substantively the same will be asked to discuss the assignment with me. If one student admits to having copied the work, or if there is clear evidence who is guilty, the guilty student will be assigned a grade of zero. If no one admits to the offense or a reasonable determination of guilt cannot be made, each student involved will be assigned a grade of zero. In either case, an Academic Honesty Violation Report will be filed, and it may result in your expulsion from the course with a failing grade as per the IIT and ITM academic honesty policies.

**Our Contract:** This syllabus is my contract with you as to what I will deliver and what I expect from you. If I change the syllabus, I will issue a revised version of the syllabus; the latest version will always be available on Blackboard. Revisions to readings and assignments will be communicated via Blackboard.

**Disabilities:** Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities.  In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources and make an appointment to speak with me as soon as possible.  My office hours are listed on the first page of the syllabus. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in 3424 S. State St., room 1C3-2 (on the first floor), telephone 312 567.5744 or disabilities@iit.edu.

**ARC Tutoring Center:** The university provides a free tutoring and study center called the [ARC](https://www.iit.edu/arc "IIT Resource Center URL").  This is located newly in the basement of the Galvin Library and is open to all for walk in appointments as well as scheduled tutoring.
